## ⚙️ About Me

Hey there! I'm a passionate student who loves building smart automation scripts and making life easier through code. Whether it's on my own home server, a Raspberry Pi, or via Docker deployments – I enjoy building systems that just run in the background and *do their job*.

I like tinkering, optimizing, and writing clean scripts that solve real problems.
